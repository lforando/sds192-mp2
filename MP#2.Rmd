#Data Wrangling: Florida

#Overall, our goal is to look at the amount of money spend for and against opponents within both major political parties in a swing state. We chose to look at Florida because it is a well known swing state, and is large enough for us to obtain enough data regarding political contributions made.


#we created a new table named florida_elections which holds information originally stored in house_elections.
florida_elections <- house_elections %>%
  #using the filter() function, we filtered to only look at information regarding the midterm elections in Florida.
  filter(state == "FL") %>%
  #using the select() function, we selected the variables from house_elections that we wanted to move to florida_elections which included: state, candidate's name, party, number of general votes, and the general winner.
  select(state, candidate_name, party, general_votes, ge_winner)

#glimpse(florida_elections)
#glimpse(house_elections)

#Next, we want to specifiy what election year we are looking into. For this particular assignment, we analyzed the 2012 midterm elections.

#we created a second table named florida_candidates which holds information originally stored in candidates. 
florida_candidates <- candidates %>%
  #using the fiter() function, we filtered out the the state we were interested in looking at (FL), the candidate election year (2010 - 2013), and filtered out any party affiliation values that are unknown (UNK)
  filter(cand_election_yr > 2010 & cand_election_yr < 2013, cand_party_affiliation != "UNK", cand_office_state == "FL") %>%
  #using the select() function, we selected the information from candidates that we wanted to store in our new variable florida_candidates; candidate ID, candidate name, and candidate party affiliation.
  select(cand_id, cand_name, cand_party_affiliation) %>%
  rename(candidate_name = cand_name)
#glimpse(florida_candidates)


#we created a third table named florida_committees which holds information originally stored in committees. 
florida_committees <- committees %>%
  #using the select() function, we selected information from committees that we wanted to store in florida_committees: committee ID, committee name, and the name of the committee's treasurer.
  select(cmte_id, cmte_name, tres_name)
#glimpse(florida_committees)

#we created a fourth table named florida_contributions which houses information originally stored in contributions.
florida_contributions <- contributions %>%
  #using the select() function, we selected information from contributions that we wanted to move to our new variable florida_contributions.
  select(cmte_id, amndt_ind, transaction_pgi, name, transaction_amt, cand_id, tran_id, transaction_type) %>%
  #using the filter() function, we filtered out transaction types to be either infavor of a candiate (24E) or in opposition (24A).
  filter(transaction_type == "24E" | transaction_type == "24A")

#glimpse(florida_contributions)

#After creating the four new tables, we combined them together, one by one, each with a common variable.

  full_join(florida_committees, by = "cmte_id") %>%
  full_join(florida_candidates, by = "cand_id") %>%

  #once the four individual tables were combined into one main table, we used the filter() function to filter out candidate party affilitation as Republican or Democrat.
  filter(cand_party_affiliation == "REP" | cand_party_affiliation == "DEM") %>%
  #using the select() function, we selected variables deemed important from the new table containing information from the four smaller tables.
  select(cmte_id, amndt_ind, transaction_pgi, name, transaction_amt, cand_id, tran_id, transaction_type, cmte_name, tres_name, candidate_name, cand_party_affiliation) %>%
  #using the mutate() function, we added the variable trans_amount which is equal to transaction amount divided by 100,000.
  mutate(trans_amount = transaction_amt/100000)
